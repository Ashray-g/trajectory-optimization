This repository contains some of the first-ever uses of trajectory optimization competitively in the FRC robotics competition.

The two models are:
- A double jointed arm (derived from the Lagrange equations of motion and motor models)
- A swerve drive robot (a robot with >3 wheels that can independently rotate and translate)
